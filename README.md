HEY!!!!!!!
If you want to have an easy time reading through all of LAtE's documentation then here's how to do it:
---------------------------------------

Step 1: GET OBSIDIAN
You'll need this to read the documents, even though they're just text files.
The formatting and linking between documents is what makes Obsidian such a nice way to view and read.

---------------------------------------

Step 2: Download the entire repository into a ZIP file.
This is the easiest way to yoink everything into one convenient file.
If you want you can delete the README and .gitignore files after extracting the ZIP file. They're not necessary to read LAtE.

---------------------------------------

Step 3: Go to Obsidian, open the folder as Vault.
(If you have opened a Vault before, the option is in the bottom left above the settings/help button)
Press Open and select the LAtE Documentation folder as vault.

---------------------------------------

Step 4: You're done. You can read now. Enjoy!
