HEY!!!!!!!
If you want to have an easy time reading through all of LAtE's documentation then here's how to do it:
---------------------------------------

Step 1: GET OBSIDIAN
You'll need this to read the documents, even though they're just text files.
The formatting and linking between documents is what makes Obsidian such a nice way to view and read.

---------------------------------------

Step 2: Download the entire repository into a ZIP file.
This is the easiest way to yoink everything into one convenient file.
If you want you can delete the README and .gitignore files after extracting the ZIP file. They're not necessary to read LAtE.

---------------------------------------

Step 3: Go to Obsidian, open the folder as Vault.
(If you have opened a Vault before, the option is in the bottom left above the settings/help button)
Press Open and select the LAtE Documentation folder as vault.

---------------------------------------

Step 4: You're done. You can read now. Enjoy!

---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------

Alternatively, if you want to contribute to this repository instead, you'll need to do a lot more.
(This gets a bit tricky so ask Bucket if something isn't right in this quick explanation)

---------------------------------------

Step 1: Be in the LAtE Discord server, obviously. If you don't have access to the scource material then don't bother.
If you want to get in ask someone you know is in the server for an invite.

---------------------------------------

Step 2: Install Fork, search "git fork" on Google and you'll probably get it.
This software allows you to make changes to the repository and upload them for maximum collaboration efficiency!

---------------------------------------

Step 3: In Fork, go to File > Clone...
Then insert the link to the repository (you can find it with the green CODE button on the root folder, then copy the HTTPS), choose a place on your PC to save your copy of the repository, give it a name (optional) then clone it!

---------------------------------------

Step 4: Make sure everything is up-to-date by pressing Fetch. Fetch allows you to view the current state of the repository. Press Pull to 'sync' your local folder with the online repository.
If you are busy with changing a file, Pulling will overwrite everything in your Local folder, and will likely remove all changes if you haven't pushed it. Make sure you haven't made changes before pulling.

---------------------------------------

Step 5: If you made any changes to the repository (by either adding, removing or editing files) you need to 'Stage' your changes. Go to Local Changes, then 'stage' all the files you changed.
Preferably add a title and description so people know what the changes are, then press commit.
Once you have committed files, press Push to send them into the repository. Make sure no one else is working on the same files as you, otherwise some conflicts might occour.
