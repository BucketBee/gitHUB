Cherie
---
> _Cherie is in her little working room._
> _She has been in there,, for 2 days_
> _Help her_
> "Dammit, what time is it?"
> _She looks at her watch and clicks her tongue._
> "Time to go get more parts then, ughh."
> _She got her furcoat and umbrella and headed outside._
> 
> _C. Pow Pow heads to the nearest grocery store to get herself more neon chips. Toodle oo, just a lady in a fancy fur coat walking around with an empty stomach._
> _She carried her cherry bombs with her just in case._
> _But as she was walking by, she looks at the rogue bots. Damn, they're hella cute._
> _She secretly wants to take one home but she's,, not great with pets. The last time she had a pet, all she fed it was chips and soder._
> _Nonetheless, the hamster died from too much sugary drinks._
> _She heard someone say 'Lucy'. Cherie turns her head to Uiess and snickered quietly._ "Lucy??"
