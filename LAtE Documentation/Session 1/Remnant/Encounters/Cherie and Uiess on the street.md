Narrator
---
> **The bot keeps scrubbing**
> “Cleaning contaminant”

Uiess
---
> "Yeah, kinda named almost every roguebot in NT"
> *he turns to cherie, still holding the rougebot

Cherie

> _She pokes Lucy with a 'boop' sound._
> "Cute little guys, aren't they, champ?"

Uiess
---
> "Yeah i love them and apparently so do some other people in NT"
> _Gives rougebot big hug_

Cherie
---
> "What do you call yourself, big guy?"
> _Cherie blows out a puff of strawberry-scented smoke._

Uiess
---
> _To self: "Big guy? First time someone called me that_
> "Uiess, you?"

Cherie
---
> _She lets the strawberry cigarette hang on her lip.
> She gave him a smile and stuck out her robo hand for him to shake._
> "Cherie Pow Pow in the flesh. Suuuuper successful mechanic aka weapon designer."
> _Cherie tips her imaginative hat at him while still sticking her hand out._

Uiess
---
> _He shackes her robo hand, feels weird but ok_
> "Super successful huh? Never heard of you"

Cherie
---
> "Well now you do. And I really gotta say, nice faceplate."

Uiess
---
> _To self again: "Crap! Does she know?? Act cool my dude_"
> "Yeah thanksss, was totally made with it"
> _Puts down the rouge bot_

Cherie
---
> _Her teenage girl accent changed to a british one._
> "Really brings out the bloody personality of no ordinary machine, bravo indeed!"
> "But being a mechanic of all sorts of weapons. I've studied robots as well."
> _Her teenager accent came back_
> "So, like,"
> "Were you originally a therapist robot based on your type of build? Because I am heeeella impressed!"

Uiess
---
>"Yeaahh, one of them therapy bots, sure do love seeing people with problems everyday!"
>_HDHDHSKSKGDVDJIDJZ_

Cherie
---
> "Don't worry. I can totally keep a secret. Besides, robots like you are super special so.."
> _She shrug and knock her head._

Uiess
---
> _Yep she already knows_
> "Say why do you look into robots so much? Most mechanics only ever focus of weapons and weird inventions for lazy people"

Cherie
---
> "Weeeell.. I am into weapons too, but robots are just so.. phuquinn awesomee!!"
> _She squealed._
> "They're technically metal people in two types! Ones that stick to their programming and just be total push overs, while the other ones are all unique and special and just do their own thing."

Uiess
---
>"Yeah, all the other therapy bots were so lame, couldn't understand a joke"
> _Thinks of memory where he bashed one in the head when he escaped getting scrapped_

> “Attention, citizens of Urbe. There has been a robbery of epic proportions in the Tabernam district. Your savings may be in danger. Please try to stop these enemies of the state.” The speaker says in a monotone voice

Cherie
---
> _Cherie's face drained of color_
> "No no no NO NO NO!!"

Uiess
---
> "You go to that bank? Cuz that's probably not good"

Cherie
---
> "Well, duh!! Where am I gonna stick my cash in? A fridge? But I really have to go. You wanna tag along, deviant boy?"

Uiess
---
>"Even if i have no bank account I'll go, i don't really do much anyways"
>_Tags along with Cherie_

Cherie
---
