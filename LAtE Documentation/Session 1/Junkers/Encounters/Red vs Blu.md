Andertoj
---
>"Why did they stop shooting?"

Leighn (2/2)
---
>"Why did they shoot"

Red soldier
---
>"There are civilians here. They are not to be harmed. Remember the Convention?"

Andertoj
---
>_Stops running and turns around_

Mayple

>:DD _Confused_

Keone
---
>_Moves closer to get a better view_
>_Wants to ask a question_

Red soldier
---
>"Civilains. I will ask you to leave this sector of the city while we do glorious battle"

Andertoj
---
>"And now the other girl is there as well?"

Mayple
---
>:DD "But something was going on tho" >u<

Keone
---
>"Wait"
>"What are you battling for?"
>"Can’t you settle this without violence?"

Mayple
---
>"Huh?" :DD

Red soldier
---
>"We're fighting over a... What was it today...? A warehouse I think."

Keone
---
>"A warehouse?"

Red soldier
---
>"Yesterday it was an office block. The day before that a park... And so on"

Mayple
---
>"I SEE! >u< I HOPE IT GOES WELL MISTER!"
>_"Go die mister" thinks to myself_

Keone
---
>"Why don’t you play rock paper scissors so that it’s fair"
>"You don’t have to fight"

Andertoj
---
>"I'm keeping my distance"

Red soldier
---
>"Rock, paper, scissors to settle feuds between billion credit companies?"

Keone
---
> _Looks at both the blue and red soldiers_
> "Yes"
> _Is hoping they won’t laugh_
> "Or something else that does not involve violence"
> "Talk it out"

Red soldier
---
>"Bosses won't talk to each other. Sibling rivalry I think"

Mayple
---
>:DD _Looks at the lady who keeps talking_

Keone
---
>"Oh"
>"I see"
>"Then why don’t you let them handle it"
>"Not you guys"
>"Are you guys really willing to risk your lives over some sibling feud"

Red soldier
---
>"Because we get paid"

Keone
---
>"Oh"
>"Will you guys still have the money once you’re dead?"

Andertoj
---
>_Starts getting closer_
>"I won't go any further than this"
>"Aha.. I'm close enough to hear what they're saying"

Red soldier
---
>"Nah. Of course not. Silly woman. Have you ever been in a war?"

Keone

>_Her memories from the past come back_
>_She tears up a bit_
>"Y-yes I have"
>_Wipes her tears_

Mayple
---
>:DD ?

Andertoj
---
>"Why is she crying?"

Red soldier
---
>**The red blushes under his mask**
>"I-I'm sorry, civilian"

Keone
---
>"It’s okay"
>"You didn’t mean it"
>"Did you?"

Red soldier
---
>"No, no. Of course I didn't"

Mayple
---
>"Yes he did" >U<
>"He meant to insult you! Men are always like that lady" >u<

Keone

Andertoj
---
>"Hmm... the ladies are leaving"
>"I guess I should too"

Red soldier
---
>"Or you could help us if you want. You'll get a free discount at any of our stores"

Mayple
---
>U-U _Kinda broke the smile with that line, but turns away_

Keone
---
>"No"
>"The last thing I want is violence"

Andertoj
---
>"Why the heck did she just hit herself"
>_Laughs a little_
>_Leaves as well_

Narrator

Keone

>"We might get hurt staying here"
>_Looks back at the scene and sees that red soldier not shooting anybody_
>_At least she was able to make one soldier stop_

>_Drinks maple syrup_
>_Walks along the pipe_ UuU
>_Sits on the pipe, which has a deep drop if I fall_ 
>"Hmm" :))
>"I wonder.... If that woman was sad" :Dc

Andertoj

>"You’re not... fighting??"

Red soldier
---
>"No. I felt too bad about what I said to you"

Mayple
---
>_Watching from behind_ :DD
>_Watches them do their business_

Keone
---
>"Huh? No, don’t feel bad"
>"You didn’t mean it"
>"So it doesn’t affect me"
>"I’m fine"
>"I wanted to ask you about a certain file I found"
>_Hands the file to the red soldier_
>"Maybe you know something about it"
>_Sits beside the red soldier_

Red soldier
---
>"Hm? I'll have a look"

Andertoj
---
>"What are they looking at?"

Mayple
---
>"May I listen too? :DD"

Keone

Red soldier

Mayple
---
>:)) "Hm... and?"

Keone
---
>"Really?"
>"Is it a weapon?"
>"An experiment?"

Red soldier
---
>"I think it's either a government sponsored weapon, an experiment or the 'missing link'"

Mayple
---
>:DD "Sounds dangerous..."

Keone
---
>"My hunch was correct"
>"Thank you soldier"
>"Now you don’t have to feel bad"
>"You can go fight now"
>_Stands up_

Mayple
---
>"Yeah! Go fight reddy!"
>"Even tho youre a guym but go!"
>_Stands up as well_

Red soldier
---
>"Hm. I'd rather sit this one out. Plus the fight is pointless anyway"

Keone
---
>"Now you see my point"
>_Pats the red soldier_
>"Glad I was able to let you see my side of things"

Mayple
---
>"Why so?" :DD

Red soldier
---
>"The companies have been at a stalemate for over a hundred years now"

Andertoj
---
>"This is so interesting"

Mayple
---
>:DD "Whoa"
>"Wow, you guys wasted 100 years fighting each other?" :DD

Keone
---
>"Hmmm"
>"So the fight never went anywhere at all"
>"Mmm"
>"Can I have the file back???"
>"Please?"

Red soldier

Keone

Andertoj
---
>"What was that about?"

Keone
---
>"I found a file about a weapon the government might use"

Mayple
---
>"Something about a dangerous experimental weapon!" :DD

Keone
---
>"Indeed"

Andertoj
---
>"Interesting..."
>"Mind if i take a look?"

Keone
---

Andertoj

Keone
---
>"Must be a very powerful man or creature"

Andertoj
---
>"What if.. what if they expirimented with this being?"
>"They might've turned it into some kind of monster"

Keone
---
>"Exactly"
>"I found these files after bumping into a scientist"
>"I want to stop it"

Andertoj
---
>"This is all starting to add up"
>"Do you know where the scientist went?"

Keone
