Keone
---
>_looks at the girl who is trying to encourage the soldiers to fight_

Andertoj
---
>"Why did they stop shooting?"

Leighn (2/2)
---
>"Why did they shoot"

Narrator
---
>"There are civilians here. They are not to be harmed. Remember the Convention?"

Andertoj
---
>_stops running and turns around_

Mayple
---
>:DDD "Are they having peace???"
>:DD _confused_

Keone
---
>_moves closer to get a better view_
>_wants to ask a question_
>_she raises her hand_
>"Ah"
>"Excuse me??"

Narrator
---
>"Yes. We remember it well" a blue says "We also remember when you broke it by rounding up people buying our products and directing them to your stores"

Keone
---
>"Ah"
>"Nevermind"
> _puts her hand down_

Narrator

Mayple
---

Keone
---
>"Nothing"
>"Nothing is going on"

Narrator
---
>"Civilains. I will ask you to leave this sector of the city while we do glorious battle"

Andertoj
---
>"and now the other girl is there as well?"

Mayple
---
>":DD but something was going on tho" >u<

Keone
---
>"Wait"
>"What are you battling for?"
>"Can’t you settle this without violence?"

Mayple
---
>"Huh?" :DD

Narrator
---
>"We're fighting over a... What was it today...? A warehouse I think."

Keone
---
>"A warehouse?"

Narrator
---
>"Yesterday it was an office block. The day before that a park... And so on"

Mayple
---
>"I SEE! >u< I HOPE IT GOES WELL MISTER!"
>_"go die mister" thinks to myself_

Keone
---
>"Why don’t you play rock paper scissors so that it’s fair"
>"You don’t have to fight"

Andertoj
---
>"i'm keeping my distance"

Narrator
---
>"Rock, paper, scissors to settle feuds between billion credit companies?"

Keone
---
> _looks at both the blue and red soldiers_
> "Yes"
> _is hoping they won’t laugh_
> "Or something else that does not involve violence"
> "Talk it out"

Narrator
---
>"Bosses won't talk to each other. Sibling rivalry I think"

Mayple
---
>:DD _looks at the lady who keeps talking_

Keone
---
>"Oh"
>"I see"
>"Then why don’t you let them handle it"
>"Not you guys"
>"Are you guys really willing to risk your lives over some sibling feud"

Narrator
---
>"Because we get paid"

Keone
---
>"Oh"
>"Will you guys still have the money once you’re dead?"

Andertoj
---
>_starts getting closer_
>"I won't go any further than this"
>"Aha.. i'm close enough to hear what they're saying"

Narrator
---
>"Nah. Of course not. Silly woman. Have you ever been in a war?"

Keone
---
>_her memories from the past come back_
>_she tears up a bit_
>"Y-yes I have"
>_wipes her tears_

Mayple
---
>:DD ?

Andertoj
---
>"Why is she crying?"

Narrator
---
>**The red blushes under his mask**
>"I-I'm sorry, civilian"

Keone
---
>"It’s okay"
>"You didn’t mean it"
>"Did you?"

Narrator
---
>"No, no. Of course I didn't"

Mayple
---
>"Yes he did" >U<
>"He meant to insult you! Men are always like that lady" >u<

Keone

Mayple
---
>:DD "Anyway!"

Andertoj
---
>"Hmm... the ladies are leaving"
>"I guess i should too"

Narrator
---
>"Or you could help us if you want. You'll get a free discount at any of our stores"

Mayple
---
>U-U _kinda broke the smile with that line, but turns away_

Keone
---
>"No"
>"The last thing I want is violence"
>"And a lot of bloodshed"
>"I’ll pass"

Andertoj
---
>"why the heck did she just hit herself"
>_laughs a little_
>_leaves as well_

Narrator
---
>**The shooting resumes. But the red they talked to keeps his gun down**

Keone
---
>_walks to Alpha_
>"Let’s go Alpha"
>"We might get hurt staying here"
>_looks back at the scene and sees that red soldier not shooting anybody_
>_at least she was able to make one soldier stop_

Mayple
---
>_goes to a nearby bridge_
>_jumps on to a pipe, and balances on it_
>"Hmm..."
>_drinks maple syrup_
>_walks along the pipe_ UuU

Narrator
---
>**A scientist rushes by, bumping into Keone**
>"S-so sorry. Very sorry"
>**She drops her files all over the street**

Keone
---
>"It’s okay"
>"It’s my fault for not looking"
>_helps the scientist with picking the files up_

Narrator
---
>**She already ran off**

Mayple
---
>_sits on the pipe, which has a deep drop if i fall_ 
>"hmm" :))
>"I wonder.... If that woman was sad" :Dc

Andertoj
---
>_walks around trying to ignore the shootout_

Keone
---
>_should she go save that soldier?_
>"Oh no"
>_looks at the files_
>_reads them_
>"Hm?"

Narrator
---
>**In big red writing it says "TOP SECRET"**

Keone
---
>"Top secret?"
>"Not anymore"
>_opens the file_
>_reads_

Mayple
---
>"I wonder how many of those soldiers are gonna die..." :DD
>"_lays on pipe_ welll.... At least less men" UuU

Keone
---
>_almost forgot about that red soldier. Is he still alive?_

Narrator
---
>**There's a drawing of a strange man with weird lines on his neck. He appears to have scales. Beneath is the words "Ichthyo Sapien - AP-1465"**

Keone
---
>"What?"
>"Ichthyo Sapien..."
>"What is this scientist going to do with this Ichthyo??"
>_closes file and thinks_
>_walks back to the battlegrounds_

Mayple
---
>_gets up_
>_goes back to the battle grounds_
>_sits and watches_ >u<

Andertoj
---
>_returns to the shootout_

Narrator
---
>**The battle for the warehouse still rages on**

Keone
---
>_looks for that red soldier and want to ask him about the file. Maybe he knows something about it_

Narrator
---
>**He's sitting alone**

Mayple
---
>_sees the lady_ :DD
>_watches the women go in the battle field_ :DD ?.
>_curious_
>_goes and follows the woman_
>_sneaks up behind the woman_
>"HELLO!" >u<

Keone

>"Hello little girl"

Mayple
---
>Hello! >u<

Keone
---
>_walks up to the red soldier_
>"Hey there"
>"You’re not... fighting??"

Narrator
---
>"No. I felt too bad about what I said to you"

Mayple
---
>_watching from behind_ :DD
>_watches them do their business_

Keone
---
>"Huh? No, don’t feel bad"
>"You didn’t mean it"
>"So it doesn’t affect me"
>"I’m fine"
>"I wanted to ask you about a certain file I found"
>_hands the file to the red soldier_
>"Maybe you know something about it"
>_sits beside the red soldier_

Narrator

Narrator

>"I think I overheard my superiors talking about this when I went to deliver them some coffee"

Mayple
---
>:)) "Hm... and?"

Keone
---
>"Really?"
>"Is it a weapon?"
>"An experiment?"

Narrator
---
>"I think it's either a government sponsored weapon, an experiment or the 'missing link'"

Mayple
---
>:DD "Sounds dangerous..."

Keone
---
>"My hunch was correct"
>"Thank you soldier"
>"Now you don’t have to feel bad"
>"You can go fight now"
>_stands up_

Mayple
---
>"Yeah! Go fight reddy!"
>"Even tho youre a guym but go!"
>_stands up as well_

Narrator
---
>"Hm. I'd rather sit this one out. Plus the fight is pointless anyway"

Keone
---
>"Now you see my point"
>_pats the red soldier_
>"Glad I was able to let you see my side of things"

Mayple
---
>"Why so?" :DD

Narrator
---
>"The companies have been at a stalemate for over a hundred years now"

Andertoj
---
>"This is so interesting"

Mayple
---
>:DD "Whoa"
>"Wow, you guys wasted 100 years fighting each other?" :DD

Keone
---
>"Hmmm"
>"So the fight never went anywhere at all"
>"Mmm"
>"Can I have the file back???"
>"Please?"

Narrator
---
>"Sure. Here you go"

Keone
---
>"Thank you"

Andertoj

Keone
---
>"I found a file about a weapon the government might use"

Mayple
---
>"Something about a dangerous experimental weapon!" :DD

Keone
---
>"Indeed"

Andertoj

Andertoj

Keone
---
>"Must be a very powerful man or creature"

Andertoj
---
>"What if.. what if they expirimented with this being?"
>"They might've turned it into some kind of monster"

Keone
---
>"Exactly"
>"I found these files after bumping into a scientist"
>"I want to stop it"

Andertoj
---
>"This is all starting to add up"
>"Do you know where the scientist went?"

Keone
